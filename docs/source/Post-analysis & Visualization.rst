Post-analysis & Visualization
=================================

**QGIS**

OnSSET is a spatial electrification tool and as such highly relies on the usage of
Geographic Information Systems (GIS).
A GIS environment is therefore necessary for two main reasons:

* Extract trivial characteristics for the electrification analysis from GIS layers
  and combine them all together in a format easy to read in python
  (a .csv file with all the attributes per population point).
* Visualize the final results in maps.

Historically OnSSET has relied on ArcGIS, but recently the process has been moved
to open source GIS environments. OnSSET in it's current form relies on QGIS
(together with in QGIS included tools from SAGA, GDAL and GRASS)
